# Staying-alive

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#

This project was developed as a part of our first-year coursework in computer science by Yonatan Reznikov and Mor Moshe. The project showcases the application of fundamental OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. These principles are utilized to create a functional and interactive application, demonstrating how different objects can interact within a well-structured system.
